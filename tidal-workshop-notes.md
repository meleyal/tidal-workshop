tidal: abstract language for describing patterns

sequences/cycles - one way of thinking about linear time

the cycle matters, not the duration

the cycle is the reference point, not the beat

like a step sequencer

you can subdivide sequences (subsequences) and they will fit the cycle

kind of like flexbox

time in tidal is about subdivisions, not inaccurate floating point numbers

inside quotes = sequence

syntax to TidalCycles

https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-midi: A TidalCycles module for sending
patterns over MIDI.
